## ***Ex2 - Game Of Pokemons***

 - [ ] This project represents the game of pokemons . The main goal of
       this game is to catch as many Pokemons as we can so that each
       catch of a Pokemon will update our grade and eventually will
       return the final grade score .  In this project we built a
       directional weighted graph and the graph will be visualized by
       using GUI class .

## **Classes that were implemented**
• `NodeData CLASS` 
This class representing a Node (Vertex ) in a directional weighted graph.

•`GeoLocation CLASS`
This class representing a position of a Node (Vertex) on a directional weighted graph.

•`EdgeData CLASS`
This class representing an Edge on a directional weighted graph

•`DWGraph_DS CLASS`
This class representing the directional weighted graph which is built with HashMaps and built from Nodes (VERTEX) and edges , which on each edge there is a weight that is represented by a number.

•`DWGraph_Algo CLASS`
This class implements algorithms that can be used on a directional weighted graph , the algorithms are : 

 1. init()
 2. getGraph()
 3. copy()
 4. isConnected()
 5. shortestPathDist()
 6. shortestPath()
 7. save()
 8. load()
 9. reverseGraph()
